## Create React Native App using React Native CLI

Run the following commands to create a new React Native project named PlantApp using React Native CLI:

```
npx react-native init PlantApp

This will start a Metro Bundler development server for you. Once youâ€™ve set up Android Studio or Xcode, you can launch your app on an Android virtual device or real device using USB by running:

On the iOS Simulator (macOS only) you can do this by running:

```
npx react-native run-ios
```

You will be able to see the app running in the emulator/simulator or a real device.
